In other words, it only builds projects whose source\nfiles have changed since the last successful build. The analysis requires a\nGit working tree, and only considers source files that are tracked by Git and\nwhose path is under the project folder. (For more details about this\nalgorithm, see the documentation for the "package-deps-hash" NPM package.)\nThe incremental build state is tracked in a per-project folder called ".\nrush/temp" which should NOT be added to Git. The build command is tracked by\nthe "arguments" field in the "package-deps_build.json" file contained\ntherein; a full rebuild is forced whenever the command has changed (e.g.\n"--production" or not).\n\nOptional arguments:\n  -h, --help            Show this help message and exit.\n  -p COUNT, --parallelism COUNT\n                        Specifies the maximum number of concurrent processes\n                        to launch during a build. The COUNT should be a\n                        positive integer, a percentage value (eg. "50%") or\n                        the word "max" to specify a count that is equal to\n                        the number of CPU cores.
