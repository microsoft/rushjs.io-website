Reads and processes package publishing change requests generated by "rush 
change". This will perform a read-only operation by default, printing 
operations executed to the console. To commit changes and publish packages, 
you must use the --commit flag and/or the --publish flag.

Optional arguments:
  -h, --help            Show this help message and exit.
  -a, --apply           If this flag is specified, the change requests will 
                        be applied to package.json files.
  -b BRANCH, --target-branch BRANCH
                        If this flag is specified, applied changes and 
                        deleted change requests will becommitted and merged 
                        into the target branch.
  -p, --publish         If this flag is specified, applied changes will be 
                        published to npm.
  --add-commit-details  Adds commit author and hash to the changelog.json 
                        files for each change.
  --regenerate-changelogs
                        Regenerates all changelog files based on the current 
                        JSON content.
  -r REGISTRY, --registry REGISTRY
                        Publishes to a specified NPM registry. If this is 
                        specified, it will prevent the current commit will 
                        not be tagged.
  -n TOKEN, --npm-auth-token TOKEN
                        Provide the default scope NPM auth token to be passed 
                        into npm publish for global package publishing.
  -t TAG, --tag TAG     The tag option to pass to npm publish. By default NPM 
                        will publish using the 'latest' tag, even if the 
                        package is older than the current latest, so in 
                        publishing workflows for older releases, providing a 
                        tag is important. When hotfix changes are made, this 
                        parameter defaults to 'hotfix'.
  --set-access-level {public,restricted}
                        The access option to pass to npm publish. By default 
                        NPM will publish scoped packages with an accesslevel 
                        of 'restricted'. Scoped packages can be published 
                        with an access level of 'public' by specifyingthat 
                        value for this flag with the initial publication. NPM 
                        always publishes unscoped packages with an access 
                        level of 'public'.
  --pack                Packs projects into tarballs instead of publishing to 
                        npm repository. It can only be used when 
                        --include-all is specified. If this flag is specified,
                         NPM registry related parameters will be ignored.
  --release-folder FOLDER
                        This parameter is used with --pack parameter to 
                        provide customized location for the tarballs instead 
                        of the default value.
  --release-type RELEASE_TYPE
                        This parameter is used with --pack parameter to 
                        provide release type for the generated tarballs. The 
                        default value is 'internal'. The valid values include 
                        'public', 'beta', 'internal'
  --include-all         If this flag is specified, all packages with 
                        shouldPublish=true in rush.json or with a specified 
                        version policy will be published if their version is 
                        newer than published version.
  --version-policy POLICY
                        Version policy name. Only projects with this version 
                        policy will be published if used with --include-all.
  --prerelease-name NAME
                        Bump up to a prerelease version with the provided 
                        prerelease name. Cannot be used with --suffix
  --suffix SUFFIX       Append a suffix to all changed versions. Cannot be 
                        used with --prerelease-name.
  --force               If this flag is specified with --publish, packages 
                        will be published with --force on npm
