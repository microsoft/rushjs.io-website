Reads and processes package publishing change requests generated by "rush
change". This will perform a read-only operation by default, printing
operations executed to the console. To commit changes and publish packages,
you must use the --commit flag and/or the --publish flag.

Optional arguments:
  -h, --help            Show this help message and exit.
  -a, --apply           If this flag is specified, the change requests will
                        be applied to package.json files.
  -b BRANCH, --target-branch BRANCH
                        If this flag is specified, applied changes and
                        deleted change requests will be committed and merged
                        into the target branch.
  -p, --publish         If this flag is specified, applied changes will be
                        published to npm.
  --add-commit-details  Adds commit author and hash to the changelog.json
                        files for each change.
  --regenerate-changelogs
                        Regenerates all changelog files based on the current
                        JSON content.
  -r REGISTRY, --registry REGISTRY
                        Publishes to a specified NPM registry. If this is
                        specified, it will prevent the current commit will
                        not be tagged.
  -n TOKEN, --npm-auth-token TOKEN
                        (DEPRECATED) Specifies the authentication token to
                        use during publishing. This parameter is deprecated
                        because command line parameters may be readable by
                        unrelated processes on a lab machine. Instead, a
                        safer practice is to pass the token via an
                        environment variable and reference it from your
                        common/config/rush/.npmrc-publish file.
  -t TAG, --tag TAG     The tag option to pass to npm publish. By default NPM
                        will publish using the 'latest' tag, even if the
                        package is older than the current latest, so in
                        publishing workflows for older releases, providing a
                        tag is important. When hotfix changes are made, this
                        parameter defaults to 'hotfix'.
  --set-access-level {public,restricted}
                        By default, when Rush invokes "npm publish" it will
                        publish scoped packages with an access level of
                        "restricted". Scoped packages can be published with
                        an access level of "public" by specifying that value
                        for this flag with the initial publication. NPM
                        always publishes unscoped packages with an access
                        level of "public". For more information, see the NPM
                        documentation for the "--access" option of "npm
                        publish".
  --pack                Packs projects into tarballs instead of publishing to
                        npm repository. It can only be used when
                        --include-all is specified. If this flag is specified,
                         NPM registry related parameters will be ignored.
  --release-folder FOLDER
                        This parameter is used with --pack parameter to
                        provide customized location for the tarballs instead
                        of the default value.
  --include-all         If this flag is specified, all packages with
                        shouldPublish=true in rush.json or with a specified
                        version policy will be published if their version is
                        newer than published version.
  --version-policy POLICY
                        Version policy name. Only projects with this version
                        policy will be published if used with --include-all.
  --prerelease-name NAME
                        Bump up to a prerelease version with the provided
                        prerelease name. Cannot be used with --suffix
  --partial-prerelease  Used with --prerelease-name. Only bump packages to a
                        prerelease version if they have changes.
  --suffix SUFFIX       Append a suffix to all changed versions. Cannot be
                        used with --prerelease-name.
  --force               If this flag is specified with --publish, packages
                        will be published with --force on npm
  --apply-git-tags-on-pack
                        If specified with --publish and --pack, git tags will
                        be applied for packages as if a publish was being run
                        without --pack.
  -c COMMIT_ID, --commit COMMIT_ID
                        Used in conjunction with git tagging -- apply git
                        tags at the commit hash specified. If not provided,
                        the current HEAD will be tagged.
