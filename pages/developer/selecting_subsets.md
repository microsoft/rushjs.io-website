[Bulk commands]({% link pages/maintainer/custom_commands.md %}) like `rush build` and `rush rebuild` operate on
all projects in the monorepo by default.  This becomes expensive as you accumulate more and more projects.
To speed things up, Rush provides a set of command-line parameters for selecting subsets of projects.

Suppose we're working with the following collection of Rush projects:

<img src="/images/docs/selection-intro.svg" alt="a sample monorepo" style="height: 150px;" />

In the above illustration, the circles represent local projects, not external NPM dependencies.
The arrow from `D` to `C` indicates that `D` depends on `C`; this means that `C` must be built before
`D` can be built.  We'll use the `rush build` command in the examples given below, but these same parameters
work for any bulk command.


## -<!---->-to

**Possible scenario:** Suppose that you have just cloned your monorepo, and now you want to start working
on project `B`.  You need to build all the things that `B` depends on, and also `B` itself.

Here's how to do that:

```shell
# Build everything up to (and including) project B
$ rush build --to B
```

The projects selected by this command are `A`, `B`, and `E`:

<img src="/images/docs/selection-to.svg" alt="rush build --to B" style="height: 150px;" />

## -<!---->-to-except

**Possible scenario:** In many cases we do not need `rush build` to process `B`, because our next step
will be to invoke Webpack or Jest in "watch mode" for `B`.  You can use `--to-except` instead
of `--to` to exclude `B`.

```shell
# Build everything up to project B, but not B itself
$ rush build --to-except B

# Invoke Jest watch mode to build B
$ heft test --watch
```

The projects selected by this command are `A` and `E`:

<img src="/images/docs/selection-to-except.svg" alt="rush build --to-except B" style="height: 150px;" />

## -<!---->-from

**Possible scenario:** Now that we've finished making our changes to `B`, we want to build the downstream
projects `C` and `D` to make sure their tests were not broken by our change.  In order to build `D`,
we also need to include its dependency `G`.  The `--from` command does this.  It will also include `A` and `E`
since they're required by `B`.  (Since `rush build` is incremental, `A` and `E` will probably get skipped assuming
they are still up to date.)


```shell
# Build everything downstream from B, including any implied dependencies
$ rush build --from B
```

This command selects everything except for `F`:

<img src="/images/docs/selection-from.svg" alt="rush build --from B" style="height: 150px;" />

> **Compatibility note:**  If the `rushVersion` setting in your **rush.json** is older than 5.38.0,
> then `--from` will instead behave like `--impacted-by`.  The meaning was changed in Rush 5.38.0 because
> most users expected `--from` to include dependencies.


## -<!---->-impacted-by (unsafe)

**Possible scenario:** Suppose that while working on `B` we made some changes to `E`.  The `rush build`
incremental analysis assumes that any change to `E` requires all its downstream dependents to be rebuilt,
including `F` for example.  That can be a big set.  Maybe you know better -- perhaps you later reverted your change
in `E`, or maybe you manually invoked the toolchain so `E` is in good shape, or maybe your change to `E` is
not relevant right now.

In these situations the `--impacted-by` parameter can be handy: It means *"Select only those projects
that might be broken by a change to B, and trust me that their dependencies are in a usable state."*

```shell
# Build B and everything downstream from B, but don't include dependencies
$ rush build --impacted-by B
```

The projects selected by this command are `B`, `C`, and `D`:

<img src="/images/docs/selection-impact.svg" alt="rush build --impacted-by B" style="height: 150px;" />

## -<!---->-impacted-by-except (unsafe)

**Possible scenario:** This is the same as `--impacted-by` except that it does not include `B` itself.  For example
that might make sense if you already built `B` manually while implementing the thing that we now want to test.

```shell
# Build everything downstream from B, but don't include dependencies
$ rush build --impacted-by-except B
```

The projects selected by this command are `C` and `D`:

<img src="/images/docs/selection-impact-except.svg" alt="rush build --impacted-by-except B" style="height: 150px;" />

## -<!---->-only (unsafe)

**Possible scenario:** As its name implies, the `--only` parameter adds exactly one project to the selection,
ignoring dependencies.

```shell
# Build only B and nothing else
$ rush build --only B
```

<img src="/images/docs/selection-only.svg" alt="rush build --only B" style="height: 150px;" />

The `--only` parameter is most useful when combined with other parameters.  For example, in our narrative above
when we did `rush build --impacted-by B`, maybe we had not actually built `G` yet.  We can include it by
doing `rush build --impacted-by B --only G`.

> **"Unsafe" parameters:** The parameters `--only`, `--impacted-by`, and `--impacted-by-except` can all fail if the
> required dependencies are not built.  These three parameters save time by assuming that you know better than Rush
> about what really needs to be built.  If that assumption is incorrect, you can always do `rush build` to get back
> to a good state.

## Combining parameters

- You can combine any of the selection parameters on a single command line.  The result is always the union of each
  individual selection.
- The same parameter can be specified multiple times. For example: `rush build --only A --only B --only C`
  will select `A`, `B`, and `C`
- Note that Rush does not provide any parameter that would reduce the selection.  This is an intentional design choice;
  in [#1241](https://github.com/microsoft/rushstack/issues/1241) we'll implement personal tags for building up more
  complex selections.)

Here's a more complex combined command-line:

```shell
$ rush build --only A --impacted-by-except B --to F
```

The projects selected by this example are `A`, `C`, `D`, `E`, and `F`:

<img src="/images/docs/selection-multi.svg" alt="rush build --only A --impacted-by-except B --to F" style="height: 150px;" />
